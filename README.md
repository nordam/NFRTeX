LaTeX templates for applications to the Norwegian Research Council. Note that these are not official templates, just a set of files that I myself have found it convenient to use. They are just prepared to look like the official Word templates, and to comply with the official requirements for font size and margins and so on. Use at your own risk.

Comments and contributions are welcome.
